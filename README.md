# JS-MERN-Assignment-one
#Reaction Tester Project

#Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create an application where users must click on a moving box as quickly as possible. After each successful click, the application will compute and display the user's reaction time. This immediate feedback mechanism aims to enhance user engagement and provide insights into their reaction speed.


#Project Requirements

1. Structure the Files
three separate files:
index.html: Holds the structure of the application.
styles.css: Controls the design and layout.
script.js: Handles the logic for moving the box and calculating reaction time.
2. Key Features
Center all text for better visibility.
Change the box's color after the result is shown.
Display the reaction time in seconds or minutes.
Ensure clear, readable, and well-organized code.
3. Use meaningful variable names.
Add comments to explain functionality.
